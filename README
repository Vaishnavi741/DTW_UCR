# **DTW_UCR: Experiments on UCR Archive Using Dynamic Time Warping**

This project explores the effectiveness of **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** as a distance measure in **1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN) classification** using datasets from the **UCR Time Series Archive**.

## **Overview**
- **28 datasets** from the UCR archive were selected for evaluation.
- Instead of using **Euclidean distance**, **DTW distance** was applied to perform **1NN classification**.
- The goal was to **assess the role of DTW** in time series classification compared to traditional methods.
- Experimental results demonstrated that **DTW outperforms Euclidean distance** in many cases, showing promising results for time series classification.

## **Key Features**
- **Implementation of DTW-based 1NN classification**.
- **Comparison of DTW vs. Euclidean distance** on selected UCR datasets.
- **Performance evaluation** using metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.

## **Results**
The experiments showed that **DTW improves classification accuracy** by capturing **temporal distortions** better than Euclidean distance. These findings highlight the **importance of DTW in time series classification tasks**.
